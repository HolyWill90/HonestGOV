Startsheet: Political Promise Tracker

Current Issues:

Lack of transparency: Political candidates often make promises during their campaigns, but there is a lack of transparency and accountability when it comes to tracking their progress in fulfilling those promises. This creates a sense of distrust among the public and undermines the democratic process.
Information overload: With numerous politicians making promises across different platforms, it becomes challenging for voters to keep track of all the promises made and to stay updated on their progress.
Time-consuming manual tracking: Currently, there is no efficient system in place to track and update the promises made by political candidates. This leads to a significant amount of manual effort and time required to gather and analyze information from various sources.
Areas for Improvement:

Transparency and accountability: Develop a web service that allows users to track the promises made by political candidates and evaluate their progress over time. This service should provide up-to-date information on the fulfillment of promises, enabling voters to make informed decisions during elections.
Automated data collection: Utilize AI and web scraping techniques to collect information about political candidatesâ€™ promises from various sources, such as campaign websites, news articles, social media platforms, and official statements.
Real-time updates: Implement a machine learning model to analyze daily news and update the list of promises for each politician on the platform. This ensures that users have access to the most current information and eliminates the need for manual updates.
Subscription-based newsletters: Enable users to subscribe to newsletters that provide regular updates on the promises made by political candidates. Users can choose the frequency of updates, such as daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly, based on their preferences.
Community-driven and open-source: Foster a collaborative environment by making the project open-source and encouraging contributions from the community. This allows for continuous improvement and ensures the platform remains relevant and up-to-date.
